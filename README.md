This is currently being used to host the HTML we pass to the online church platform to implement a [Cloudflare stream player](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-stream/).

It's very simple to use, just use this iframe for the embed code:
```html
<iframe src="https://yubodiwu.github.io/?src={VIDEO_ID}&startTimestamp={UNIX TIMESTAMP (SECONDS SINCE EPOCH)}" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
```
